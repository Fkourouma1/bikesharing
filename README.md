# bikesharing
# Overview 
In our project, we are helping Jeremy perform a statistical test using the programming language R. Our research will be based on CitiBike in New York then use that result to convince potentials investors to replicate the same type of business in De Moines, IOWA. We will accomplish summary test, statistics test and interpret the results.  This project will lead us to three deliverables:
## Deliverable 1
Using the NYC Citibike starter code, we’ll use Pandas to change the datatype of the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours and minutes. 
Then, we’ll export the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the visualizations in Deliverable 2.

## Deliverable 2
We are determining whether a bikesharing venture will be successful. We would create tableau visualization from New York bikesharing data to answer questions such as:
- how many bike trips were recorded during the month of August?

- what is the number of short-term customers and annual subscribers?

- what is the demographics of bike riders in New York?

- what are the top starting locations and the top ending locations?

- what are the peak hours?

- what are the typical checkout times?

- what is the typical bike utilization? Answers to these types of questions will help determine if a similar bike sharing business will be successful in Des Moines, IOWA.

### Summary 
The analysis of the New York bike sharing data provided the following insights:
- The month of August is a good month for biking recording 2,344,224 trips
- 81.07% of bike riders are annual customers and 18.93% are short-term customers.

- The ratio of male bike riders to female bike riders is 3:1

- Thursdays between 5pm and 8pm is the peak period for the month of August.

#### Additional Analysis
To provide further insight, we may perform the same set of analyses for Summer time compare to winter. This type of analysis can help determine any pattern or trend to the demand for bike-sharing services for the year
Another visualization we may perform is determining how many start stations are also end stations for the same trip. Knowing that a bike trip started and ended in the same location can help illuminate questions around the number of stations required for a specified geographic area.
